# beer_afternoon

This is a very simple app that fetches random beer data from 'random-data-api.com/api/v2/beers'.
Since it contains a single ephemeral state, using Business Logic Component to manage state is
a little overkill, however I wanted to showcase BLoC implementation as well as separation of data,
business logic and presentation layers.
